# RISC-V-Simulator

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a RISC-V Simulator capable of running the given RISC-V assembly instructions using a C++ program.

## Overview

This project focuses on supporting a subset of the RISC-V instruction set, specifically the base integer instruction set (RV32I), which is commonly used in educational and industrial applications. The simulator is designed to handle different instruction formats such as R-type,I-type,S-type,B-type,U-type and J-type instructions but doesn't support for pseudo-instructions that simplify assembly programming.

## Instructions

- This application allows all formats even ecall and ebreak is supported.
- The application is space sencitive. So bad spaces will cause the application to give error.
- If any comment is present after a instrection there shoud be atleast one space between instructon and comment.
- Project can only handle 50 lines excluding comments.
- Any files with assembly code can be tested using `tester.py` irrespective of its name.

## Project Expandability

- If needed more instructions can be added to the `risc_v.h` file.
- New Instruction type can be added by making a function in `instruction.h`.
- The maximum line of input file can be increased by just chenging the 50 in `data.h` and `data.cpp`.
- The application can be made to support for pseudo-instructions by adding a new function in `instruction.h`
- The project can  be made to support for more than one file by making a loop in `main.cpp` and calling  the `tester.py` for each file.
- We can improve the  application by adding a GUI to it.

## Installation

Make can be used to install the application in your personal repo or folder:

```console
make all
```

Make all will compile the files and give you a riscv_asm.exe file which can be run using:

```console
./riscv_sim
```

Specific .o files can be compiled by the following commands:

```console
make data.o
make encorder.o
make instruction.o
make main.o
make parser.o
make utils.o
make cpu.o
make memory.o
make executor.o
```

Then clean can be used to clean all the files:

```console
make clean
```

Python file can be used to test the project.

```console
python tester.py
```
